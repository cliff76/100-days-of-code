# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 5th, 2017
##### Tic Attack Toe?

**Today's Progress**: I struggled through a React Todo app example. I also investigated how to work custom deployment on Azure. The custom deploy scripts are local and have not yet been pushed. I'll tackle Azure this weekend.

**Thoughts:** 
Faking the funk! I've been missing days and not making much progress. My log is looking abysmal as I've taken on two significant challenges for the year. The 1st and more important challenge is my Bible study which is also at risk of slipping. Add my day job and kids to the mix and its a wonder I can find time to set reminders for Alexa by asking Google to tell Siri about it! I spent most of my time re-learning REact/Redux as well as webpack, gulp, while tinkering with Yarn. I spend more time learning than coding but it's all in the same spirit. I'm hoping that pattern changes soon as I pick up speed.

### Day 4: January 3rd, 2017
##### Tic Attack Toe?

**Today's Progress**: I struggled through a React Tic tac Toe example.

**Thoughts:** 
Barely got this working before 12am

### Day 3: December 31st, 2016
##### If you build it, will they come?

**Today's Progress**: Mostly project structure changes and refactoring. I managed to integrate gulp for managing the build of both client and server pieces. I plan to continue refining the build until I get things in a way that make me feel productive.

**Thoughts:** 
webpack, vs, npm, vs gulp... So many ways to build a JS project. I only started with webpack because I want to learn how to use ES6 for client side stuff as I start re-learning ReactJS. I'm mostly familiar with gulp and npm. I've started delegating npm build script targets to my gulpfile and I want to get the whole hot file reloading for development. I need to be careful because each push triggers a redeploy of my Azure server. Also I have many dev dependencies listed as general dependencies. I need to keep this for now until I learn more about continuously deploying nodeJS on Azure.

[Azure Deployment](http://100dayscraig.azurewebsites.net) It renders still! (I think!)

### Day 2: December 30th, 2016
##### It continues

**Today's Progress**: Guilty! I didn't commit yesterday but I did make progress from the day prior! I learned about [some open public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) which I may consider using. I finally managed to get webpack and Babel working for client side ES6.

### Day 1: December 28th, 2016
##### It continues

**Today's Progress**: I created an Azure WebApp for this project. I then started a NodeJS project in IntelliJ. Pushed it to Github (from the cmd line b/c our in-office proxy was giving me all sorts of problems) then Added ExpressJS to the mix. I then linked my Azure site to my newly created GitHub project using the new portal and GUI options. I deployed the Express app to the site but it didn't render initially. It was because I wasn't using the production port assigned by Azure. Googling "start azure nodejs deployment" pointed me [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started) where I found my fix!

**Thoughts:** Azure seems to dramatically update each year while prompting you to try their "new portal" and abandon the old one. Didn't I just do this 1-2 year(s) ago? I think I'll really enjoy re-familiarizing with NodeJS, Express, and tinkering with the new Azure deployment and continuous delivery stuff.

### Day 0: December 28th, 2016
##### It begins

**Today's Progress**: I begin the challenge by forking this repo,  and setting up the log. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to study OAuth 2.0 and try to do some hack integrations with 3rd party service providers like Flickr or Twitter. I've never done much with OAuth2.0 so this should be fun!
