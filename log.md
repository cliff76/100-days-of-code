# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28th, 2016
##### It begins

**Today's Progress**: I begin the challenge by forking this repo,  and setting up the log. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to study OAuth 2.0 and try to do some hack integrations with 3rd party service providers like Flickr or Twitter. I've never done much with OAuth2.0 so this should be fun!

### Day 1: December 28th, 2016
##### It continues

**Today's Progress**: I created an Azure WebApp for this project. I then started a NodeJS project in IntelliJ. Pushed it to Github (from the cmd line b/c our in-office proxy was giving me all sorts of problems) then Added ExpressJS to the mix. I then linked my Azure site to my newly created GitHub project using the new portal and GUI options. I deployed the Express app to the site but it didn't render initially. It was because I wasn't using the production port assigned by Azure. Googling "start azure nodejs deployment" pointed me [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started) where I found my fix!

**Thoughts:** Azure seems to dramatically update each year while prompting you to try their "new portal" and abandon the old one. Didn't I just do this 1-2 year(s) ago? I think I'll really enjoy re-familiarizing with NodeJS, Express, and tinkering with the new Azure deployment and continuous delivery stuff.

### Day 2: December 30th, 2016
##### It continues

**Today's Progress**: Guilty! I didn't commit yesterday but I did make progress from the day prior! I learned about [some open public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) which I may consider using. I finally managed to get webpack and Babel working for client side ES6.

**Thoughts:**
